# Data Visualisation

Welcome to my Data Visualization portfolio, where I transform complex datasets into compelling visual stories. By using tools like Tableau, I aim to create intuitive dashboards and storyboards that make data insights accessible and actionable. My work is driven by a passion for clarity, ensuring that every visualization not only informs but also inspires decision-making.

## [Tableau] Drinking Water Dashboard/Storyboard

This project involves the creation of a comprehensive storyboard to analyze global access to drinking water, with the objective of identifying potential target countries for improving water access services. The study is twofold: modernizing water access services and optimizing water access policies.

To achieve this, we examined various key indicators:
- Total Population and its Urban/Rural Distribution
- Share of Population with Access to Water and its evolution over time
- Mortality Rate Linked to Unsafe Water
- Political Effectiveness, which integrates the Political Stability Index, the share of access to drinking water, and the mortality rate associated with unsafe water

These indicators are presented at three levels(global, continental, and national) to provide multiple perspectives on the issue. The storyboard effectively communicates the state of drinking water access around the world, utilizing datasets related to countries, political stability, and mortality rates associated with unsafe water. This visualization serves as a tool for stakeholders to make informed decisions regarding water access initiatives.
